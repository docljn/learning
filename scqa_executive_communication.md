# SCQA & Executive Communication:
- AKA: How not to waste time, and hence money - yours and others' [Barbara Minto, Michael Dearing, McKinsey]
- video with full transcript https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/executive-communication/

## Summary
- Situation: This is the state of affairs
  - A clear, crisp, unambiguous statement of the facts, making your assumptions explicit
- Complication: This is what is changing
  - The thing that's changed, making things more difficult
  - This is what is stopping us from making progress
- Question: What should we/you do
  - should be obvious based on S&C
  - often a version of "What should we do?" or "What should we be working on"
- Answer: Do this
  - in pyramid form
  - a one-sentence overview answer first with supporting evidence for each component
  - 3 components (max 5) to the answer, each with at least one piece of supporting evidence

## Structure
- SCQ together should be
  - non-controversial
  - easy to swallow
  - comprehensive, including all necessary background information
- Q should be whatever is necessary for resolution of the complication
- A should be
  - based on evidence
  - modular
  - presented in order
  - a resolution of the complication

## To consider
- can sound prescriptive to the recipient
  - Answer: explicitly state "Draft" to convey that this is the start of a discussion
- can be intimidating to the recipient
  - Answer: explicitly ask for input/feedback
- can be personally risky to the provider
  - Answer: ask for SCQA input from multiple individuals, then synthesise/decide on a final approach
  - Answer: all parties should agree on an approach to avoid individual blame/shame if the "A" turns out not to be completely successful
- can be a huge mental task for the provider
  - Answer: brainstorm and/or collaborate on each section
  - Answer: accept that the initial version will not be perfect, or even necessarily good

## Remember
 - the question which naturally appears after S & C can be "So what?"
 - if it is, rethink your approach
