# Feedback

"How we learn about ourselves, and our place in and impact on the world."

Feedback sits in an awkward place between our need to be accepted for who we are, and our need to learn and grow (which implies that we aren't actually good enough right now).

Historically, feedback training was provided to the giver.

In actuality, no matter how much authority or power a feedback giver has, the receiver is in charge, not the giver. They decide whether to accept the feedback, what action to take, and even whether to listen to the feedback at all.

The feedback process will only really improve when the receiver gets better at receiving feedback!

## Main Types of Feedback

- Evaluation (ranking: where do I stand)
- Coaching (growth: how can I improve our relationship, or my skills)
- Appreciation (you matter: I'm ok and accepted just as I am)

## Unhelpful (and common) Reactions to Feedback

- Blame Absorber:
  - it's all about me, I'm terrible, useless, hopeless, no good
- Blame shifter:
  - it's not me, there's nothing I can do about it, it's hopeless

## Reasons we Reject Feedback

### Mismatch

- we may reject feedback if it's the "wrong" type - if what we wanted/needed doesn't match what was offered
- we may reject feedback if it feels meaningless
  - coaching, and to some extend appreciation, needs evaluation to provide a floor to stand on
  - coaching needs appreciation (specific, authentic, in a form the receiver values) to provide a safe space where you know that what you are doing is recognised before you think about how to improve
- we may misinterpret one kind of feedback as another
  - it's not what the giver intended that matters
  - it's what the receiver actually heard
- getting two types of feedback at the same time is seldom effective
  - e.g. evaluation + coaching
    - if the evaluation is worse than you expected, you're not hearing the coaching - you're imagining all the ways you could dispute the evaluation
    - if it's better than you expected, you're not receptive to coaching - you don't need it!
  - in other words, don't coach someone during their appraisal...

### Triggers which Block Feedback

- truth(what)
  - it's just plain wrong (inaccurate, bad advice, not true)
- relationship(who)
  - I didn't like/respect/trust the feedback giver or their competence
  - I didn't like the way the feedback giver treated me
- identity(your sense of self and your wiring)
  - the feedback isn't aligned with my values
  - that's not who I am!
  - I just wasn't receptive: too young, too stubborn, in love(maybe)
  - my strong reaction to feedback meant I couldn't hear it
  - my innate wiring meant I didn't notice it

## Wrong-Spotting

- humans are really good at spotting what's wrong with feedback
  - if it's wrong, we can ignore it, relax, and carry on as before
- even if it's 90% wrong, or we don't believe the giver is qualified to provide feedback, there can still be something to learn from it

### STOP 1, before you reject feedback out of hand

- consider
  - what type of feedback do you want vs what you are getting (appreciation/coaching/evaluation)
- clarify: "tell me more?"
  - what does the giver want: why are they giving feedback now?
  - what is the giver trying to tell you
    - what data / observations are they basing their feedback on
    - what story are they telling
  - what story are you telling yourself (and how much of that is a hangover from past feedback / interactions?)
  - if you chose to take action based on the feedback, how confident are you that you would know exactly what to do
  - if consequences or expectations are implied, are you sure you both mean the same thing - and if not, why not
- explore
  - look for what is different rather than what is wrong
  - what are some reasons why the feedback might be right
    - try it on for size, even just as a thought experiment
    - you can always stop if it turns out that taking action based on feedback wasn't helpful!

### STOP 2, before you react to feedback

- find a better mirror:
  - a supportive mirror: "I'm not really like that, am I?"
    - you on your best day, in flattering light
    - someone who can help you recover your equilibrium
    - necessary if the feedback has hit you hard - asking for help and support is not a bad thing!
  - an honest mirror: "How am I like that?"
    - you right now, when you're not at your best
    - someone who can help you see what's legitimate in the feedback
    - you cannot see your own face - or your own impact on others
- uncross your wires
  - feedback isn't an invitation to solve a problem: it's an invitation to understand the feedback
  - if you respond to your feelings about the feedback you end up with two people giving feedback and no-one receiving
    - each person believes the other is the problem, when the situation is always a result of both of you being the way you are in the current situation
- take your time: particularly if you know you react strongly to feedback
  - prepare in advance if you can: what would bad news really mean
  - remember that now is not forever

### STOP 3, boundaries

- you do not have to accept (or even sometimes be willing to listen to) every piece of feedback you are offered
- clues that you need to set a boundary
  - your character is attacked, not your behaviour
  - when you change, there is always one more demand
  - it's always you that needs to change
  - your views and feelings don' count
  - the relationship is taken hostage: do this, or else
- useful phrases when setting boundaries
  - I may not take your advice
  - I don't want feedback about that subject, not right now
  - Stop, or I will leave the relationship
- be specific when setting boundaries
  - I need _specific request_ over _this timeframe_ or I will _consequence_
  - remember that you are asking someone to change, and they will make mistakes

### STOP 4, if you choose not to change

- you don't get a free pass
- you must try to mitigate the cost of your choice for others
- work together to solve the problem
- ask them about the impact of your choice

## Getting more useful feedback

### Ask a one-thing question

- don't ask "Got any feedback for me?"
  - it puts people on the spot
  - about what?
  - how honest?
  - what's the right answer?
- Don't as "is there anything?" - assume there is!
  - What’s one thing you particularly appreciate about me?
  - What’s one thing you see me doing — or failing to do — that gets in my way?
  - What is one thing you think I should change?

### Steer towards responding as if the feedback was coaching

- it's easy to misinterpret coaching as evaluation and vice versa
  - implicit in coaching feedback is the idea that you are not actually OK as you are
  - explicit in evaluation feedback is the fact that you are being measured and ranked and (likely) found wanting

- in both cases, your defenses will be up, and it will be hard to avoid "wrong spotting" and discounting everything said

### Evaluate your response to an evaluation

- any evaluation includes
  - assessment (your ranking)
  - consequences (of the ranking)
  - judgement (the stories each of you tell about the ranking)
- give yourself a score for how you respond to, and how well you learn from, an evaluation

## Managing a feedback conversation

- before you dive in, ask yourself
  - is this feedback?
  - if so, what kind?
  - is this feedback final or negotiable?
- during the conversation
  - listen for what is right or different
  - let the giver know they are heard
  - talk! you need to provide your data and context
  - signpost any changes in direction
    - e.g. if you notice you're both giving feedback, agree which version will be dealt with when
  - problem solve together
    - often feedback is the giver's best guess at a solution to a problem they haven't articulated
    - if you can work out what they want/need you may be able to find something different that works for you both
- close with commitment
  - action plan
  - benchmarks
  - consequences
  - procedures
  - new strategies
