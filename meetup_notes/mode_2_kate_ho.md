# What do we build next?
Kate Ho @ Sainsbury's Bank

## Summary
- fall in love with the problem, not the solution
- find ways to have conversations with stakeholders
- deliver value early and often (align product with delivery, meaning devops *has* to be involved too)

## Prioritisation & Product Management
- The ideal
  - a neat cycle
  - ideas and feature requests are captured in detail
  - a groomed backlog provides clear guidance on what to do next
  - products are shipped which match clearly defined specifications according to the priorities set out in the backlog
  - users provide detailed and useful feedback
  - metrics guide the discussions which feed into reprioritising the backlog

- The reality
  - the backlog = a dumping ground of ideas
  - the next product increment = who shouts loudest
  - feedback = goes into a contact centre black-hole and is never seen again
  - what to build next = debates and escalations about what should be done first

- The result
  - the team is confused about priorities
  - there no alignment/direction to deliver
  - the wrong thing is done, or the right thing is done in the wrong way

## A Better Approach
- you need to understand the pain points of your customers
- what do they need/want to do?
- what is stopping them from doing it?

## Techniques which may help
### PRFAQ from Amazon
- work backwards
  - write a press release
  - write the FAQs
- focus on what the customer will actually care about

### Jobs to be done
- people hire your product to get a job done
- this is a way to get away from personas and towards situations/scenarios
- the reason a person chooses a particular product will vary depending on their context: ask them!
- how do you find customers to ask?
  - dissatisfied customers who have contacted your firm
  - recent purchasers
- your competition is often not someone doing the same thing, but something which does that job (fulfils that need) in a totally different way

- just providing a 'better' product which solves a customer problem is not enough to drive customer uptake
  - you need to overcome habitual choices, and anxiety around making a new choice

### Opportunity score
- ask your customers to answer two questions on a scale of 1 - 10:
  - How important is it to you that you can <functionality provided by new feature> when you use <existing/competitor product>?
  - How easy is it for you to <functionality provided by new feature> at the moment?
- the bigger the gap between what they want/need to do and how easy it is, the greater the opportunity

## Framing Product Discussions
### The problem
- everyone has an opinion, and that's the problem
  - the loudest voice / hippo often dominates
- the backlog is the wrong place to start working
  - the backlog is the difference between where you are and where you think you need to be
  - you need to look elsewhere: user story mapping is a better place to start
    - what do you want to do, and what are the different ways of achieving it
