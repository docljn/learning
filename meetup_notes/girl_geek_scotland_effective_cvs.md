# Girl Geek Scotland: Effective CVs
Hosted by [Modulr](https://www.modulrfinance.com), 3 April 2019

An initial presentation by each of the panelists was followed by small group discussions amongst all attendees.

## Key Points
- a good CV is one that will get you through the door for an interview
  - short: a maximum of two sides of A4
  - easy to scan for key information, with no fancy formatting
  - tailored to the specific role and firm
  - specific about what and how you have achieved things relevant to the new position
  - if you are a career changer, consider what your past roles would be called in your new industry and include both titles in your cv

- a good cover letter is one that will get your CV read by the right person
  - more useful if you have experience that makes you a perfect fit for the role but which is hard to highlight in a CV
  - less useful if you are applying through a recruiter, as they will be writing their own cover letter to go with your CV

- each of the panelists had very personal preferences around CV and cover letter content and formatting, so make sure you know what the expectations are in your target industry, country and culture


# The Panelists

## The Recruiter: Rhona @ Cathcart
Twitter: @scottishdevjobs / [Cathcart Associates](www.cathcartassociates.com)

### Why do recruiters insist on word?
- they need to be able to remove your contact details
- their crm database doesn't handle pdf files at all well
- 2 or 3 different software systems may have to parse the document before it ever reaches a human

### Document formatting
- no headers/footers
- no text boxes
- postcode is essential as a lot of boards search based on location
- keep formatting as simple as possible

### Speed is your recruiter's top priority
- simple formatting
- important info front and centre
- reverse chronological order
- minimise mistakes & typos
- ask for help if you need it
- no photos - you're on LinkedIn so don't waste space/time

### Cover Letter
- the recruiter will add a covering letter so don't stress about that unless you're applying on spec/direct to firm
- cover letter is more useful if you are more senior and need to highlight key achievements
- don't lead with "I'd like to apply for the job you have advertised on ..."
- all you need is enough to get the recipient to read your CV


## The Director of Engineering: Dave @ Calero Software

### Purpose of a CV
- get you in the door for an interview
- used twice
  - initial screening
  - interviewer prep
- remember that the person interviewing you at the first stage is unlikely to have hiring authority  

### A good CV
- front and centre: three key achievements, followed by the detailed job history
  - saves the reader the time of scanning through looking for those achievements
- short (no really, shorter than that)
- easy to scan
  - bullet points
  - bold key words
- don't stress over formatting
  - that will get mangled as it goes through recruiter/crm/company portal etc  
- deep skill in one or two languages (if coding!)
  - not a shopping list
  - remember the cv can (should) change depending on the company you're applying to
- detail on only the last couple of roles
- education detail only if you've not much experience

### Differentiators
- github/stack overflow gives reassurance that you can do what you say you can
- specific relevant experience or skill tailored to the role you're applying for
- concrete achievements (especially in your last role)
  - what did you do and what was the result
- hobbies and interests, if you mention them, can help the interviewer see you as a person
  - ice-breaker in the interview
  - can you link them to desired job/person characteristics
- be aware of unconscious bias in your recruiter: you need to show your value and avoid triggers
- transferrable skills


## The In-House Company Recruiter: Eva @ Craneware

### Do
- think like an employer
- 6 seconds to read your cv
- cf. [Aimee Bateman](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/aimeebateman)
- tailor to the role
- easy to read/scan/identify key features
- include key works and phrases
- important stuff in the first/top section

### Layout
- clearly defined sections
- personal details
- personal statement
- education if school leaver
- expereince

### Personal Statement (a marketing document)
- what is the one thing that everyone says you are amazing at
- what gets you excited
- what have you accomplished
- what are you most proud of
- what makes you get out of bed in the morning
- what do you enjoy doing the most
- what do you love most about your current/past job
- ask people who know you to describe you in three words
- remember to provide evidence for the adjectives you use about yourself

### Achievements
- 3 key achievements
  - display your character and commercial value
  - what would impress your interviewer the most
- LinkedIn
  - up to date
  - expand on cv

### Work experience
- reverse chron
- bullets
- avoid 'I was responsible for' and just start with 'responsible for'
- quantify the impact you had
  - significantly, reliably, diligently, consistently
- highlight how what you have done will be relevant and useful in the specific role you're applying to  

### Education
- reverse chron
- professional and academic quals
- include soft skills & training courses
- school can be left out unless you're a school leaver
- highlight non-work learning/achievements if there are breaks

### Tricky Topics
- career breaks: include in the timeline
- temp roles: highlight that you are adaptable, fast learner etc
- dismissal: probably not on the CV (!) but be prepared to talk about it

### Differentiators: Personality
- link your interests to the role you're applying for
- what attributes is the employer looking for: match to your personal attributes and provide evidence
- what is your 'why'



## The Public Sector Recruiter: Anne-Marie @ University of Edinburgh Online Learning
- your cv will be scored against each of the criteria listed in the job description
  - this is the one time a shopping list of skills is actually useful on a cv
- hobbies and interests are a waste of time here, as they cannot be taken into account in the scoring matrix
- you can generate a cv from your LinkedIn profile: do edit it afterwards though
