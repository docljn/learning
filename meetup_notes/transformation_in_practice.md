# Transformation in Practice
-- Lan O'Connor: Scotland Women In Technology 2018

When approaching change, the statement is often: "We've got to change because xxxxxxxxx!"
This is the *presenting issue* and is seldom, if ever, the actual reason.
Make no assumptions, and investigate until you are certain you have found the root cause.
Ask people who are new to the business to highlight things which don't make sense to them and start from there when considering what can/should change

## Why change?
There is always one of two kinds of measurable problem in an organisation or situation
1. **Defect:** we are doing worse than expected
2. **Ambition:** we are not doing as well as is possible

## How to get buy-in
Find a simple, relevant action that makes sense across all communities, with one single metric that shows progress, success, or failure.
- connect your ultimate target to the levers that you can act on
- if your target isn't measurable, find rational and measurable levers that will enable you to reach that target
Learn how your organisation makes and executes decisions
- can you change that?
- there will be rational reasons for decisions, political reasons for decisions, and emotional and personal reasons
  - rational & political reasons lead to change
  - **emotional reasons are required for change to become transformation**
- there has to be something in the reasoning which is relevant to everyone: those who will make the change as well as those who will permit the change to be made even if they do not need to do anything themselves
Start with something that will deliver quickly
- operational improvements will deliver measurable benefits faster: start there and get buy-in as you build momentum and provide a proof of concept for the benefits of change
- digital change without transformation will bring increased revenue but no increase in profits (cf. [The Digital Advantage](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The_Digital_Advantage__How_Digital_Leaders_Outperform_their_Peers_in_Every_Industry.pdf) from Capgemini)


## How to maintain focus
Develop an overarching aim/ambition statement
- not numbers
- an image of the future (a cartoon can work well)
- something that will engage both those who have to make it happen and those who have to let it happen

## Timescales
- the average timescale for a whole-organisation transformation is 10 years: reduced to 3 years in tech because it is proportional to the rate at which your people churn
- when a new person starts, the way things are done is the 'new' way, and once a critical number of people are doing things that way, it becomes the default way to do things
