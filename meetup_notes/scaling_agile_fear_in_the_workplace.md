## "Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the organisation"
Deming: principle 8 of 14

When designing a survey you *must* include:
- context
- quantitative
- qualitative

## Key findings
- fear exists in every workplace
- females feel imposter syndrome more often (or admit to feeling it?)
- hr procedures trigger fear - judge, appraise, etc
- people are scared to speak about being scared
- some hr departments said their workers couldn't take part: what is our liability???!
- fear is inversely proportional to innovation and productivity

## We've known this for a long time
"is it better to be feared or loved" -- Michiavelli
"One can only see truly with the heart, what is essential is invisible to the eyes" -- Saint-Exupery

## What is fear?
"You feel fear when there is something meaningful to you that you would like to protect."
Fear leads to an inability to act
Fear is the opposite of, and reduced by, self affirmation
