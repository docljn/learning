# From Developer to Manager:
Jeff Swan @ Sainsbury's Bank

## What have I learned?
### management is a people job
- you are no longer making the technical decisions (if you try, it usually doesn't work well)
- the people you need to consider fall into two general groups:
  - team (your content)
  - org (your context)
    - customers
    - prospects
- you must focus on the needs of your team so they can focus on the needs of the customer

- engagement and motivation are essential (but not sufficient) for team & individual performance
  - without engagement you will get someone's professional minimum
  - this isn't about the time someone puts in, but about their intention and attitude

### Intrinsic motivators
- Dan Pink : Drive

  - autonomy (shift the boundaries to give people space and show them trust: they do need boundaries though, to be safe)
  - mastery (what if you don't train people, and they stay..?)
  - purpose
- Joshua Kerievsky's modern agile

  - make people awesome
  - make safety a prerequisite
  - experiment and learn rapidly
  - deliver value continuously

### Tackling organisational challenges
- the relationship between teams is what makes organisations work
- being the best team is useless if you can't collaborate well
- business-as-usual organisational forces tend to constrain achievement and outcomes (local optima vs global optima)
- everyone is doing what they are being measured and rewarded for
- different groups value different things:
  - c.f Wardley: pioneer, settler, town planner [https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html)
  - consider how to get groups to value the skills/input/needs of other groups?
- don't focus on counting what's easy to count
  - look at the impact / outcome and work out how to articulate the value that matters
- move fast and break things?
  - it's not sustainable
  - the rest of the org stops trusting you & pushes back
  - build relationships and trust first, and show you are taking care of what matters to them

## Why be a manager?
- people
- perspective
- potential

- bring your developer attitude to learning into the role: 'Just Read Stuff'
