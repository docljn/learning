## Levelling up

### junior actions
  - **on your own**
  - challenge yourself / accept a challenge from your manager
  - fix bugs
  - practice (koans and similar, open source contributions)
  - study design & notice connections
  - write down what you've learned
  - work on your communication, networking and inter-personal skills
  - **with others**
  - participate in code review with your peers and seniors
  - pair / mob program
    - discuss expectations before you start
    - one computer only (possibly multiple keyboards)
    - the less experienced developer has the keyboard first and most often
    - in a mob, the most experienced developer should not use the keyboard much
    - if you tune out, take a break
  - ask for help (rubber duck, then human)
    - when to ask for help
      - no forward progress for 30 mins, AND
      - taken a break from the computer and still stuck  
    - information to have written down before you ask for help
      1. situation details
      2. end goal
      3. everything you've tried
      4. what google searches you've made
      5. errors received
      6. how to reproduce the problem
  - take the lead in a project
    - decide on architecture
    - break up project into manageable tasks
    - track progress
    - ensure test coverage
    - QA (manual and automated)
    - deploy
    - fix post deploy bugs

### manager/supervisor actions
  - develop a culture where it's OK to fail
  - work on your communication, networking and inter-personal skills
  - encourage questions, and provide guidance not answers
  - arrange mentoring
  - teach the team (pair / mob program)
  - frequent checkins

## why do juniors suffer
A lot of developers believe that their true skill lies in their ability to solve any problem alone, given enough time.
With this attitude, if a colleague appears to need mentorship, the developer can see this as offensive, and a sign of personal failure on the part of that colleague.

Being skilled at Mentoring does not follow automatically from being skilled at your job: mentoring skills must be actively learned

### Things to try when growing your juniors
1. Codify a format to use when asking questions
  - Explain the failure path: what are the steps you take to encounter the problem
  - What do you expect to happen
  - What actually happens
  - Full error text / stack trace if available
2. Help your juniors to formulate their questions to match the expected format
  - they will learn far more than if you just jump to the answer
  - some questions can't be formulated like this, and that's OK too
3. No technical conversations in private messages
  - everyone should be able to participate and learn from your experience
  - the team lead can see what the most frequent questions are, and hence where training might be needed
4. It's not that questions are stupid, but asking a certain type of question can make the asker feel stupid
  - provide guidance to a safe space to ask stupid questions e.g. anonymous public IRC
5. Seniors often assume that they need to explain basic coding knowledge to juniors: more often, the lack is business knowledge or tooling knowledge
  - if your application has atypical abstractions, dependencies or patterns: document them & discuss their effect & the reasons you chose to implement them with your new developers
  - small classes are easy to read and reason about, but make understanding the overall functionality more difficult
  - consider screencasts as documentation: get a senior to talk though why a particular piece of code exists and what it does
6. Pairing
  - can fail miserably if the gap in skills/knowledge is too large
  - sometimes just watching an experienced dev work can teach you more, as the senior doesn't know what they know and hence cannot teach it
  - this is particularly useful for debugging in production, reading technical docs, etc.
7. Remember Retention and Promotion
  - affirm the hire: remind your juniors that you know it is difficult and you believe they belong on the team
  - simply say: "you were a good hire"  
8. Support time-wasting
  - make sure people know that taking breaks and socialising at work is part of the job
  - to do that: as a manager, join in the fun/banter/gif-sharing so that it's obviously acceptable
9. Better use of investment time
  - prioritise depth over breadth (breadth is everywhere...)
  - give your juniors something big to build that doesn't have stakeholders breathing down their neck
  - let them take the time to learn in depth: avoid context-switching
10. Long form technical writing
  - write a tutorial / blog article every time you learn something as a junior
  - solidifies their knowledge
  - seniors can then add to/clarify/edit the article and everyone learns more
  - builds your company brand
11. If your dev wants to become a senior
  - let them 'audit' technical meetings and learn by watching
  - show them the work they will be doing after their next promotion
12. Listen to your juniors: they are generally more competent than you give them credit for
