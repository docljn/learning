## How to make sure what you want to happen, happens

### What are Objectives and Key Results

#### Objective

- a single sentence describing a single specific thing
- Qualitative and Inspirational
- Time Bound (month to quarter)
- Actionable by the Team Independently (can't blame others for not achieving it)
- Aligned with the overall company objective (ideally there should only be one!)

#### Key Results

- **three things you have a 50% chance of achieving this quarter**
- quantifiable
- agree when setting these what each score level looks like
  - 10: nearly impossible
  - 7: difficult, but attainable
  - 3: achievable with minimal effort
  - 0: unacceptable and requires explanation
- driven by the objective, not vice versa
- answers `how would we know if we met our objective?`
- difficult, not impossible (50/50 chance of success)
- show that you are getting better at your job
- show that you are contributing to making the company better
- A Key Result is NOT something you do, it IS something that happened because of what you did. Save the tasks for the weekly priority list.
- **NB:**
  - do not change your objective or metrics during a quarter - failure === learning  
  - do not treat these as part of a performance review - they are goals, not expectations
  - rewards should be based on achievements, not on meeting aspirational goals
  - remember to keep the ship running - keep tabs on the stuff you can't afford to mess up as well
    - code quality
    - customer satisfaction
    - revenue

### OKRs are for

- things you’re worried you’re NOT going to do, not for tracking things you will
- ensuring that you do something well that you might otherwise coast
- protecting the dreams you're afraid you'll abandon

### Setting your Objective and Measurements

- What is the most important thing to keep an eye on this quarter? Pick **ONE**
- Focus on what *won't* get done
- Focus on what *must* get done
  - picture all the things in your life as plates you are juggling. Some are made of clay, some are made of crystal, and some are made of paper.
  - if it’s clay, and you drop it, you won’t care. It’s just clay. If it’s paper, it won’t be hurt if you drop it. But crystal is valuable, and if you drop it it’s all over.
  - work out what one thing is crystal for you and how to measure whether you are achieving it
- consider: can I really look at this every week for three months and be ok with these goals?
- “the best is the enemy of the good.” Good enough tracking is just that: good enough.
- Metrics tracking is essentially habit building. (http://tinyhabits.com/)

### Assessing progress

- Close out the last quarter with learning
  - how close did you come to achieving your objectives, by measurable result
  - what did you learn from each result
  - http://eleganthack.com/tracking-and-evaluating-okrs/
- How much time should you spend exploring new possibilities, and how much exploiting ones you have proven work?
  - A problem with OKRs is that they seem to be designed for exploiting — driving performance in known areas — and not for exploring.
  - Enter the hypothesis OKR.
    - the objective is a hypothesis about a success state
    - the key results are the metrics that prove if it’s true.

  - An example from the author:
      O: Model life as a professional author
      KR: Book selling in two more languages with 90% five-star reviews
      KR: Rough draft of CF to Alpha reader list with actionable feedback
      KR: Working with Pictures V2 on Amazon with 4 five-star reviews
    - I wanted to test a hypothesis: I can be happy and financially viable writing while teaching part-time.
    - When you know what your objectives are, tactics quickly become clear. I want more books in the market. I have a lot of ideas and knowledge but I don’t scale. Therefore, get help.

### Report Format

#### Overall notes

- background info to the current situation if required

#### Objective (Set at the start of the quarter)

- single sentence describing overall objective for the quarter

#### Results

Confidence that you will achieve your results at the end of the quarter.
1 is never going to happen and 10 is in the bag.
Not your progress to achieving the goal as in x% complete.
Use red for < 5/10, black == 5/10, green > 5/10 & no other colours!

- x/10 : measurable result 1
- x/10 : measurable result 2
- x/10 : measurable result 3

- Last Week's Priorities
  - P1
    - % success : name of priority - reason if not 100% achieved
  - P2
    - % success : name of priority - reason if not 100% achieved
  - don't overthink the % success - 10 steps is plenty  

- Next Week's Priorities
  - single sentence description for each of up to 3 P1 and up to 3 P2
  - meaty accomplishments that encompass multiple steps
  - fewer is better

- Risks & Blockers
  - things you cannot control and/or cannot fix without help
  - if you can fix a blocker yourself, just fix it, don't list it
  - things you know of that might keep you from achieving your priorities

- Notes
  - relevant, timely information that doesn't fit anywhere else
  - e.g. praise for colleague that needs to be widely shared, reminder of team night out, etc

### Why Report At All

- remind everyone, including yourself, why you are doing the things you did
- include your confidence for each metric as a best guess on how likely it is that you will meet your key results
  - you can track progress
  - you can correct early if needed
- include your progress on prioritised tasks
  - learn what keeps you, and hence the organisation ,from accomplishing what needs to be accomplished
- you need someone to keep you on track: very few people can be accountable only to themselves
- if you and your boss have different ideas of what is a P1 / P2 this enables discussion
