# Mentoring: Being a Mentee
- [K Wu @ RailsConf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNnBowC-2ds)

## Background
- mentor vs sponsor (Cate Huston)
  - mentor: gives you perspective
  - sponsor: gives you opportunity
- when it doesn't work
  - random match of mentor and mentee with good intentions but no real agenda
  - nothing changes as a result of the relationship
- when it does work
  - get jobs you don't think you're qualified for
  - career change
  - conference talk opportunities
  - salary negotiation coaching
- to be a good mentor you need
  - experience
  - aptitude
- to find a good mentor you need
  - to be comfortable with asking for help from others
  - to play to your strengths and interests
  - get creative
- why would you want a mentor anyway?
  - it's good for your career
  - it helps to demystify the world
  - it helps you understand your options
  - if you can learn something the easy way rather than the hard way, why not?

## ok what can I do?
- always be mentee-ing
  - short term is just fine
  - e.g. I want to give my first conference talk, can you help?
  - design your relationship
- find your kindred spirits
  - they don't need to accept the name/title in order for you to learn from them
- who might make a good mentor?
  - similar personality and communication style
  - different experiences or surprising thinking
  - someone you admire and can also be vulnerable with
- redefine networking
  - getting to know people without strings
  - giving positive, thoughtful feedback
  - sharing their projects with others
  - taking people up on their offers of help
- embrace the awkward
- make it easy for the person to say yes
  - conversations vs emails : each person will have a preference
  - offer a few options on scheduling, time and location
  - take the initiative on the administrivia
  - no homework needed for your mentor: they just need to be present
- keep it low-key and casual
  - if you can, call it an 'unofficial mentor'
  - be specific about why you're reaching out to that specific person
    - e.g. I'm reall interested in your opinion on, or I really respect your work on...
- make it easy for them to help
  - it's ok not to know what to talk about
  - ask for experiences/stories rather than advice, and then look for patterns/insights
  - sample topics:
    - problem solving re current dilemmas, options, feedback on yout proposed solutions
    - decision making
      - anything that's every mentioned as case-by-case
      - technical intuition
      - what made you decide to..?
      - what factors should be considered
      - what would have lead to a different decision
    - behind the scenes
      - how much effort did it actually take to hone those skills
      - how did you do that
      - what was your strategy to achieve your goal
      - how did you work through a mistake
    - personal feedback
      - what do you see in my performance/approach that I could do better
      - I want to get from X to Y in my career: what do you think I should be focussing on, and what kind of path would be most helpful.
      - how can I be perceived as more...?
      - what would be helpful for me to learn about?
- you don't have to take all the advice that you are given
  - think about it, consider it, and discuss it
- make it feel rewarding to mentor you
  - not literal gifts!
  - specific thank you messages: tell them how you made use of their advice
  - follow up and stay in touch
  - people love to hear from you when you don't want something from them
- pay it forward, and mentor others
