# ﻿Leadership and Trust

Trust is the one thing that changes everything. Without it there will be no continuous improvement, and no long term success.  Don’t use the word trust though, when providing feedback. Identify exactly where the breech is. Focus on behaviour rather than character. The word trust can cause total shutdown of a conversation.  If there is no trust you often end up talking about people rather than with them.

**Trust**
Choosing to make something you value vulnerable to another’s actions.

**Distrust**
Deciding that what is important to me is not safe with this person in this situation, or any situation.

## The Anatomy of Trust
Key behaviours that build trust: a tool for conversation and feedback

### B: Boundaries
Ask what’s ok and what’s not ok, and be willing to say no.
### R: Reliability
Do what you say you’ll do.
Be aware of your competencies and limitations so that you can deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities.
### A: Accountability
Own your mistakes, apologise, and make amends.
### V: Vault
Don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share.
### I: Integrity
Choose courage over comfort, and what’s right over what’s fast, fun or easy.
Practice your values rather than simply professing them.
### N: Non-Judgement
I can ask for what I need and you can ask for what you need
We can talk about how we feel, and ask for help, without judgement.
### G: Generosity
extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others
