## The Basics

- you may find it easier or harder than presenting in person
  - there is a lot of variation in online presentations: webinar, muppet-show, presenter:host conversation etc
  - practice with the controls in the platform you will be using: buttons, chat, queues etc
  - people may be seeing your slides on a monitor, but also maybe on a phone screen, so allow for different levels of fidelity

- timekeeping
  - respect breaks
  - be punctual, and control your time

- engagement
  - use your hands to speak
  - identify the visual frame and use your hands to fill it — pay attention to what your audience can see in the online platform

- presenter tips
  - always accept the invitation to a pre-presentation tech check from the organisers
  - make sure you can see a clock and be aware of the passage of time
  - be aware of the timezone of your audience and use their time and their frame of reference
  - avoid high contrast lighting i.e. don't sit with your back to a window
  - if you can, use one screen for what you are sharing — slides — and another for your presenter notes, chat etc (but check with tech support if the platform supports this)
  - have a backup plan
    - conference organiser on speed dial, email, whatsapp, chat etc.
    - tethering option if the internet goes down
  - practice and learn from your mistakes
  - work out what makes you feel comfortable when you are presenting

## Extras

- don't use embedded video if you can avoid it
  - it's often problematic as what is transmitted is optimised for static content
  - some platforms allow you to change settings to improve the quality of what is shared
- always aim to have direct Q&A at the end
- be explicit about how you will be doing communication, e.g for Q&A
- you can choose to respond to live chat in the talk if there are questions which could be explored as part of your existing flow
- remember you are not in a meeting: you need to bring energy to your presentation


There is nothing more dangerous than an idea, when you have only one idea.
